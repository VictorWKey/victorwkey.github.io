        Hello! I'm <span class="text-primary font-medium">Víctor Ángel López Romero</span>, a 22-year-old AI Software Engineer from Guanajuato, México.
        My fascination with Artificial Intelligence started during university when I was amazed by how AI could perform seemingly complex tasks.
        After deep research, I discovered that AI is actually a beautiful combination of 
        <span class="text-primary font-medium">pure mathematics, algorithms, logical reasoning, and immense computing power</span>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        This revelation fascinated me because I found a field where I could apply all my mathematical knowledge and unlock its true potential. 
        By combining Artificial Intelligence with modern web development — with 
        <span class="text-primary font-medium">JavaScript being my gateway into programming</span> — I now focus on creating 
        <span class="text-primary font-medium">intelligent applications that enhance productivity</span> and help people save valuable time.

        Hello! I'm <span class="text-primary font-semibold">Víctor Ángel López Romero, a 21-year-old AI Software Engineer from Guanajuato, México.</span> 
        My fascination with Artificial Intelligence started during university when I was amazed by how AI could perform seemingly complex tasks. 
        Is it magic or something more? After deep research, <span class="text-primary font-semibold">I discovered that AI is actually a beautiful combination of pure mathematics, 
        algorithms, logical reasoning, and immense computing power.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-gray-100 text-base sm:text-lg lg:text-xl leading-relaxed">
        This revelation fascinated me because <span class="text-primary font-semibold">I found a field where I could apply all my mathematical knowledge</span> 
        and unlock its true potential. By combining Artificial Intelligence with modern web development, 
        with <span class="text-primary font-semibold">JavaScript being my gateway into programming</span>, I now focus on creating 
        <span class="text-primary font-semibold">intelligent applications that enhance productivity</span> and help people save valuable time.

## 📚 About Me

I’m an AI Engineer passionate about building intelligent, scalable, and secure AI systems. With a full-stack background, I integrate advanced AI into robust web and mobile applications, ensuring high performance, seamless UX, and secure deployment on private infrastructure. My focus is on developing **cost-effective** and **production-ready** AI workflows for startups and enterprises alike. I quickly learn new concepts and keep up to date with the latest advancements in the AI field.

**Key Areas of Expertise:**
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** GPT (OpenAI), LLaMA (Meta), Claude (Anthropic), open-source (Hugging Face) and others.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Designing and integrating RAG pipelines to enhance context-aware responses.
- **AI Agents & Multi-Agent Systems:** Building intelligent agents capable of tool use and complex reasoning.
- **Fine-Tuning & Prompt Engineering:** Customizing models for specific tasks and optimizing prompt strategies.
- **Model Optimization & Cost Efficiency:** Improving performance and reducing infrastructure costs on private and cloud environments.

### 🚀 Projects

#### **FitCoachAI** – Workout Progress Tracker  
FitCoachAI is a mobile app powered by a multi-tool, LLM-based agent that helps intermediate-level lifters track and analyze their training progress. The app features a **Simple RAG System** that infers missing details from past workouts, providing additional context for more accurate responses. It also uses **NL2SQL**, converting natural language queries into SQL commands for logging and updating workout data. The **QA system** allows users to ask about their training history and receive insights based on past sessions. FitCoachAI simplifies workout tracking, helping users stay focused on their fitness goals.
